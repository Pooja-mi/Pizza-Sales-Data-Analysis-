## Project Insight  
- Orders are highest on weekends, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings.  
- The maximum number of orders are recorded in the months of July and January.  
- The Classic category contributes the highest sales and total orders.  
- Large-sized pizzas contribute the maximum revenue share.  
- The majority of revenue comes from a few top-performing pizzas.  
- Clear daily and monthly order trends are observed.

## Final Conclusion  
To increase future sales, the restaurant should focus on promoting high-performing pizza categories such as Classic and Large-sized pizzas. Marketing campaigns should be targeted during peak days and months (Friday, Saturday, July, and January). Low-performing pizzas should be reviewed to optimize the menu and improve profitability. Data-driven decision making using dashboards will help sustain business growth.
